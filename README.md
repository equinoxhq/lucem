# Lucem
Lucem is a small wrapper over [Sober](https://sober.vinegarhq.org) to provide some QoL improvements. \
Please keep in mind that while Lucem is fully open source software, Sober is proprietary for a very good reason, that being to preserve RoL from 9-year-old skiddies.

# Disclaimer, in big bold letters.
Lucem does not allow you to bypass the (reasonable and justified) restrictions the Vinegar team has put on Sober's ability to load APKs that are modified.

If you really cheat on Roblox, I'd say you should reconsider your life decisions than anything. \
**Lucem is not associated with the VinegarHQ team or Roblox, nor is it endorsed by them!**

# Features
- GTK4 + Libadwaita GUI to modify settings
- GTK4-based FFlag editor that is easy to use
- Rich presence
- Server region notifier
- If you're not a fan of GUIs, we provide a nifty configuration file that does the same thing! (located at `~/.config/lucem/config.toml`)
- (Semi-automatically) downloading and managing the Roblox APK
- Managing Sober

Whilst not a feature you use directly, Lucem also caches API calls whenever it can in order to save bandwidth and resources.

## Patches
Lucem provides the following optional patches. All of them go under the `tweaks` section in your configuration.

### Bring back the old Oof sound
```toml
oldOof = true
```

### Use another font
Both OTFs and TTFs are supported.
```toml
font = "/path/to/your/font.ttf"
```
