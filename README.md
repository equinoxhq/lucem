# # lucem 3.x
This branch contains code for Lucem 3.0, a complete rewrite of Lucem from the ground up in Rust instead of Nim.

**THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! We hope to release a testing builds for public consumption soon.**

## <img width="512" src="src/assets/lucem-title.svg">
Lucem is a small wrapper over [Sober](https://sober.vinegarhq.org) to provide some QoL improvements. \
Please keep in mind that while Lucem is fully open source software, Sober is proprietary for a very good reason, that being to preserve RoL from 9-year-old skiddies.

## Contact/Support
You can open issues for bugs. \
We now have a Discord server! You can join it [here](https://discord.gg/Z5m3n9fjcU)

## Disclaimer, in big bold letters.
Lucem does not allow you to bypass the (reasonable and justified) restrictions the Vinegar team has put on Sober's ability to load APKs that are modified.

If you really cheat on Roblox, I'd say you should reconsider your life decisions than anything. \
**Lucem is not associated with the VinegarHQ team or Roblox, nor is it endorsed by them!**
